# 1. What is JavaScript?

## Definition and Purpose of JavaScript

- JavaScript is a **programming language** used to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
- It is primarily used for **client-side scripting**, meaning it runs in the user's browser.

## Importance in Web Development

- JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of web development, alongside **HTML** (structure) and **CSS** (style).
- It allows developers to add **interactivity**, such as animations, form validation, and interactive elements on web pages.
- JavaScript can also be used on the **server-side** with Node.js, making it versatile for full-stack development.

# 2. JavaScript History and Evolution

## Inventor of JavaScript

- **Brendan Eich** (Netscape, 1995)
- Created to make websites interactive (form validation, animations, etc.)
- Original names: **Mocha** → **LiveScript** → **JavaScript**

## Evolution of JavaScript

- **1997**: Became **ECMAScript** (standardized by **ECMA International**)
- **2005**: **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript) for faster, dynamic web pages
- **2008**: Google introduced the **V8 engine**, improving JavaScript performance

## New Versions of JavaScript

- New versions released by **ECMA TC39** committee (e.g., **ES5**, **ES6**)
- Regular updates with new features for modern web development

# 3. JavaScript Syntax

## Basic Syntax Rules

- **Case Sensitivity**: JavaScript is **case-sensitive**, meaning `myVariable` and `myvariable` are treated as different identifiers.
- **Semicolons**: Statements in JavaScript typically end with a **semicolon** `;`, although it is optional in most cases. It's a good practice to use semicolons to avoid errors.
- **Comments**:
  - **Single-line comment**: `// This is a comment`
  - **Multi-line comment**:
    ```js
    /* 
    This is a 
    multi-line comment
    */
    ```

## Writing Your First JavaScript Program

```javascript
// A simple JavaScript program
console.log("Hello, World!"); // This will print "Hello, World!" to the console
```
